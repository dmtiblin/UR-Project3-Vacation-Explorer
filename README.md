# I haven't been everywhere, but it's on my list!

## Background 

After nearly two years spent living through a pandemic, many cautious would-be travellers are wondering where it is safe to go. And not only that, but where are we allowed to go and with what restrictions?

Our team wanted to provide a comprehensive travel exploration dashboard for these individuals where their various concerns could be visualized all at once (as opposed to traversing the depths of the internet until all of a sudden you're 20 tabs deep!)
